# Prime-Number-Generator-and-Checker
Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have only two factors: 1 and themselves. The goal of this project is to develop a Python program that can:
	1.	Check whether a given number is prime
	2.	Generate all prime numbers up to a given limit

This project is implemented using Python in Google Colab, utilizing efficient algorithms for prime checking and generation. Below is an overview of our approach.
